#Mike's dotfiles

Just an uploaded copy of my current dotfiles. Subject to change constantly.

##Features
* vim configurations
* bash aliases for everything
* way too many functions
* environment settings
* git completion
* custom prompt with awesome stuff
* a partial reimplementation of DuckDuckGo's Bang Commands
* a script that opens a random page to a lipsum generator


Feel free to use anything from it!

##Install

To install, clone it to a directory named `.dotfiles` in your home directory, then run `~/.dotfiles/install.sh`.
You can name it whatever, this is just the name I use.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sprngr/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
